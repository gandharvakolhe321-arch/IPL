<p>
The name CSK was given to the team to honour the rulers of the Tamil Empire. The word Super is generally used in South India most specifically in Tamil Nadu. Apart from this, the name also derives from the brand India Cements- Coromandel King.</p>
<p>

The logo of CSK has a roaring lion that is in orange colour with the name of the team highlighted in blue colour. The significance of the logo resembles qualities such as youth, solid performance, vibrancy and fiery spirit. The colour of the t-shirt is usually yellow and blue in colour with orange stripes on both sides of the jersey. 
</p>
<p>
IPLS started in the year 2008, the first two tournaments were good for the CSK team although they did not win the whole team showed good potential. They had excellent players in the team which made them very strong rivals. 
</p>
In the year 2010, CSK won their maiden IPL title under the leadership of MS Dhoni. In the same year, CSK also won the CLT20 championship. 

Next year, with MS Dhoni as a captain Indian Team won the world cup, as well as CSK, won the IPL title. Dhoni was at the peak in his career at that time, but after that, in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 they performed well but did not win any title. 

Like any other group, CSK was also involved in some controversies; there was a major downfall of the franchise as some members of the board were involved in unwanted activities. Because of this, the whole team was in shock and were also banned for two years from playing IPL.
</p>
<p>
Following this, the CSK players were bought by other teams and the whole CSK team was disintegrated. Fans were very saddened and disheartened due to this disintegration of the team. But in the year 2018, CSK made a very good comeback in the IPL tournament. All the players were happy to be back in the same team and they placed the match with all their strength and won the IPL title of 2018.</p>

Mumbai Indians are one of the most successful franchise in the history of the Indian Premier League (IPL). They are the first team to have won the title as many as five times – 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2020. In addition, they also triumphed in the now-defunct Champions League T20 twice – in 2011 and 2013.
</p>
<p>
Mumbai have featured in every edition since the launch of the IPL in 2008. Before the inaugural season, MI purchased legends like Sanath Jayasuriya, Harbhajan Singh, Shaun Pollock, and Lasith Malinga. However, despite a strong squad presence, Mumbai struggled to make much of an impact in the early years of the T20 league.</p>
<p>
After being eliminated in the league stage in the first two editions, Mumbai made the final in 2010. However, they finished runners-up, going down to Chennai Super Kings (CSK) by 22 runs in the finals. Mumbai’s fortunes experienced a turnaround in 2013 when Rohit Sharma led them to a maiden IPL triumph. This time, MI defeated CSK by 23 runs as Kieron Pollard hammered an unbeaten 60 off 32 balls.</p>
<p>
Subsequently, Mumbai Indians became a force to reckon with in the cash-rich T20 league. They again beat CSK by 41 runs to lift the title in 2015. Rohit led from the front, clobbering 50 off only 26 balls. Mumbai’s third IPL triumph came in 2017 when they beat Rising Pune Supergiant by one run in a thrilling final. All-rounder Krunal Pandya starred with 47 off 38 in a low-scoring summit clash. With the ball, Mitchell Johnson starred with 3/26.</p>
<p>
Mumbai also became the first and only side to lift IPL titles in consecutive years. In 2019, they again beat CSK in a humdinger by one-run in a last-ball finish. Malinga famously trapped Shardul Thakur with a slower ball yorker to end the game. In 2020, MI eased past first-time finalists Delhi Capitals to become the first side to lift five IPL crowns. </p>
<p>
The last two seasons have not been memorable for Mumbai Indians. They finished fifth in 2021. For 2022, MI had to release most of their players and build their team literally from scratch as the mega auction took place. They had a disastrous season, finishing 10th out of 10 teams. They were fourth in the points table in 2023 but lost to Gujarat Titans in Qualifier 2. They finished 10th in 2024.</p>
<p>
In 2017, MI became the first team to cross the $100 million mark in brand value among the IPL franchises. According to a report, the brand value of MI in 2024 was estimated to be around $119 million .<br></p>
